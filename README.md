# LaTeX Guide

This is a quick-start LaTeX guide with all the nifty little tricks
I've picked up in 2.5 years of using LaTeX.  It's an on-going project
to which I'll continuously add more content.

To build the guide, simply run

    arara main

and [Arara](//github.com/cereda/arara) will take care of it.
