\chapter{Closing Remarks}
%
Well, it's been quite a journey, hasn't it? I originally intended this
to be $\sim 10$ pages long, but it seems I gravely underestimated.  It
contains all the stuff I've learned in my 2.5 years of using
\LaTeX---except what I know of \verb|beamer| (that may come later) and
\verb|minted| (doesn't work on Overleaf).  I have tried to include all
the tips and techniques that have cost me so much time and late nights
to learn---all in an effort to prevent it from happening to you.  I
hope my objectives are met when you read this document.

Finally, I'd like to ask something of you.  The world is built one
little brick at a time.  But the process is often marred by greed and
selfishness.  Lets not be like that.  I did this out of the kindness
of my heart, expecting nothing in return but a promise you will make
only to yourselves: that you will do your best to spontaneously help
others whenever you can.

With that, I give you my thanks and wish you all the best.
